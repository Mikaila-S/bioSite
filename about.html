        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Keri Steinbrugge is a fifty-two year old mother of two. She has lived in Ohio her whole life studying Biological science at Wright State University. She was the first person in her immediate family to graduate from college. She has used her degree to work for a company that does DNA testing and had risen through the ranks to become a shift supervisor. She enjoys going to concerts with her kids, crocheting and reading.</p>

<p>Keri got into crocheting more after she decided to quit smoking to give her something to distract herself with. Saying that with the money she is saving she can buy as much yarn as she wants to. Her favorite things to make are trivets since they are quick to make even with a pattern on them. She has been trying to make some for everyone in her family for Christmas with some of their favorite things in them. She has made other things such as tops, blankets, coasters and hats. She likes to joke that she should sell what she has made but would never actually go thought with it without major assistance. </p>

<p>In the future she would like to be able to have more free time without having to stress about her employees lives or about the people in her family being healthy. Being able to just relax without having anything else going on, to be able to read books on the beach.
